# About:
This is a project in Java Application Development class (capstone course). This demonstrates what we have learned during CS major such as data structures, database, unix programming, web application, and software engineering. This project is inspired by one of the applications used in physics class in university. We improved it by adding more user-friendly UI, admin page, and additional functionalities such as automatic grading. I did backend development in Django.

# Instruction: 

1. How to compile: 
2. How to execute: run python manage.py runserver in terminal
3. Expected output: 
4. Known issues: 

# What I learned:
The most important thing that I learned is how not to do something. Of course I learned backend and frontend development more but we often found a wrong way to implement something. I think this is important because next time we do a similar thing, we will know how to do it properly.
